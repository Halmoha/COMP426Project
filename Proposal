Red Redistribution

Group Members: Mattheus Bezerra, Cindy Wang, Cameron Simbeck, and Hamad AlMohaimeed.

Description: 
We will create a website that provides a service similar to YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red). This site will use YouTube’s API to search for videos matching specific search terms, topics, locations, publication dates, and much more. In doing so, we can provide custom playlists for music that may not be released on premium platforms such as Spotify or Tidal. We will also use the API to feature popular videos on the home page. Our plan is to draw only from audio files that are accompanied with videos. Users will be able to create accounts and create/share custom playlists from these videos specifically for audio listening. 
	The website covers the fundamental requirements of this project. It will be hosted online, allowing for access from anywhere in the world, provided that the user is connected to the internet. It will be coded in conjunction with APIs released by Google, allowing for use by chromium-based browsers. Users will be able to log in to save, modify, and delete playlists that they craft themselves, and would be able to share and browse their friends’ playlists. When creating playlists, users will be able to search for videos and be given the same recommendations as on YouTube. Suggestions would be provided for videos or playlists that are similar to what the user is searching for, fully implementing a dynamic autocomplete function in our search bar.
	In our backend, we would be utilizing databases of playlist information that would be updated as the users interact with their playlists or the playlists of their friends. We can implement a search bar as an HTML field where auto-completed suggestions for songs appear. We could use debouncing to limit the users in searching very quickly, or appending to their existing playlists.
